# Review of OOP using Java

The purpose of this repository is to review and 
practice key concepts that are crucial in understanding
object-oriented programming. These concepts include:

- Encapsulation
- Accessor methods
- Mutator methods
- Local vs Instance Variables
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

These concepts will be explored by creating few
simple projects.

## Additional Notes

### Private vs Public:
In Java, these keywords in front of variables, classes,
etc. determine which parts of your code have access to
other parts of your code. Doing so helps us "encapsulate" 
our code into nice little bundles of logic, and helps
the programmer segment our code and potentially prevent
unwanted changes from occurring.

### Accessor (getter) & Mutator (setter):
The instance variables of a class is often set to be 
private, but we can still edit & read them by creating 
getter and setter method.

### Constructor Parameter Naming Convention:
Oftentimes, we may see constructors have parameters
with the same name as the instance variable.
```java
public Person(String name){
    this.name = name;
}
```
This can be read as - "set `this` `Person`â€˜s instance 
variable name equal to the variable passed into the 
constructor."

Sometimes other people may use different name for the 
argument, to prevent confusion. 
```java
public Person(String inputName){
    this.name = inputName;
}
```
Both are valid approach for typing up the constructors
in Java.

Like in JavaScript, `this` keyword is a reference 
to the current object.

### Static vs Non-Static:
If a method is static, it means that it can be called
and used without having to create an object of the class.

```java
class Numbers {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Call method using the Class name, the dot operator, the method name, and arguments
    int smallerNumber = Math.min(3, 10);
    System.out.println(smallerNumber); // Prints: 3
  }
}
```
For non-static method, an object needs to be created first
in order for that method to be invoked:

```java
class Numbers {
  int firstNumber;
  int secondNumber;
 
  public Numbers (int num1, int num2) {
    firstNumber = num1;
    secondNumber = num2;
  }
 
  // non-static method
  public int returnSum() {
    return firstNumber + secondNumber;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create an object
    Numbers myNumbers = new Numbers(2, 5);
    // Call a non-static method on object
    int sum = myNumbers.returnSum();
    System.out.println(sum); // Prints: 7
  }
}
```

In short, static means that a variable or a method 
belongs to the class itself instead of belonging to a 
particular object of the class.

### Composition:
