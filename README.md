# Review of OOP using Java

The purpose of this repository is to review and practice key concepts that are crucial in understanding object oriented programming. These concepts include:

- Encapsulation
- Accessor methods
- Mutator methods
- Local vs Instance Variables
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

These concepts will be explored by creating few simple projects.

## Additional Notes

### Private vs Public:
In Java, these keywords in front of variables, classes, etc. determine which parts of your code have access to other parts of your code.
Doing so helps us "encapsulate" our code into nice little bundles of logic, and helps the programmer segment our code and potentially prevent unwanted changes from occuring.
