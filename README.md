# Review of OOP using Java

The purpose of this repository is to review and 
practice key concepts that are crucial in understanding
object-oriented programming. These concepts include:

- Encapsulation
- Accessor methods
- Mutator methods
- Local vs Instance Variables
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

These concepts will be explored by creating few
simple projects.

## Additional Notes

### Private vs Public:
In Java, these keywords in front of variables, classes,
etc. determine which parts of your code have access to
other parts of your code. Doing so helps us "encapsulate" 
our code into nice little bundles of logic, and helps
the programmer segment our code and potentially prevent
unwanted changes from occurring.

### Accessor (getter) & Mutator (setter):
The instance variables of a class is often set to be 
private, but we can still edit & read them by creating 
getter and setter method.

### Constructor Parameter Naming Convention:
Oftentimes, we may see constructors have parameters
with the same name as the instance variable.
```java
public Person(String name){
    this.name = name;
}
```
This can be read as - "set `this` `Person`â€˜s instance 
variable name equal to the variable passed into the 
constructor."

Sometimes other people may use different name for the 
argument, to prevent confusion. 
```java
public Person(String inputName){
    this.name = inputName;
}
```
Both are valid approach for typing up the constructors
in Java.

Like in JavaScript, `this` keyword is a reference 
to the current object.

### Static vs Non-Static:
If a method is static, it means that it can be called
and used without having to create an object of the class.

```java
class Numbers {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Call method using the Class name, the dot operator, the method name, and arguments
    int smallerNumber = Math.min(3, 10);
    System.out.println(smallerNumber); // Prints: 3
  }
}
```
For non-static method, an object needs to be created first
in order for that method to be invoked:

```java
class Numbers {
  int firstNumber;
  int secondNumber;
 
  public Numbers (int num1, int num2) {
    firstNumber = num1;
    secondNumber = num2;
  }
 
  // non-static method
  public int returnSum() {
    return firstNumber + secondNumber;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create an object
    Numbers myNumbers = new Numbers(2, 5);
    // Call a non-static method on object
    int sum = myNumbers.returnSum();
    System.out.println(sum); // Prints: 7
  }
}
```

In short, static means that a variable or a method 
belongs to the class itself instead of belonging to a 
particular object of the class.

### Inheritance:

There are few ways to achieve polymorphic behavior
in Java. Though **inheritance** can be good because it 
promotes re-usability and reduce code redundancy, most
projects will often choose to go with **composition**.

The following list highlights some issues with 
inheritance in OOP:

- Inherited functions work slower than normal function 
as there is indirection.
- Often, data members in the parent class are left 
unused which may lead to memory wastage.
- Inheritance increases the coupling between parent
class and child class. Any change in parent class will
affect all the child classes.

_In inheritance, a "child class" is a "parent class"_

- An orange is a fruit
- A dog is an animal
- An aircraft is a vehicle

```java
class Vehicle {

    String color;
    double weight;
    double speed;

    void move() {
        System.out.println("The vehicle is moving");
    }

}

public class Aircraft extends Vehicle {

    String passengerCount;
    String pilotName;
    String airline;

    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Onward and upward!");
    }
    public static void main(String... inheritanceExample) {
        System.out.println(new Vehicle().speed);
        System.out.println(new Aircraft().speed);
        new Aircraft().move();
    }

}
``` 

### Composition:
In composition, "has-a" relationship is more 
semantically correct than "is-a" relationship between
classes. This gives composition some advantages over 
inheritance:

- More flexible, since making changes to the 
implementation of one of the class will not affect the
other class like the way it does with inheritance 
(parent & child)
- Does not break encapsulation like inheritance does.
- No conflict between methods/properties names

_In composition, a "class" has a "class"_

- A person has a heart (heart is part of the person)
- An aircraft has a jet engine (jet engine is part of the aircraft)
- A house has a living room (a living room is part of a house)

```java
public class CompositionExample {

    public static void main(String... houseComposition) {
        new House(new Bedroom(), new LivingRoom());
        // The house now is composed with a Bedroom and a LivingRoom
    }

    static class House {

        Bedroom bedroom;
        LivingRoom livingRoom;

        House(Bedroom bedroom, LivingRoom livingRoom) {
            this.bedroom = bedroom;
            this.livingRoom = livingRoom;
        }

    }

    static class Bedroom { }

    static class LivingRoom { }

}
```
